    copy the input board to a local variable
    if the color is black
        check if the position is won or lost

        loop through all moves for black
            make a new board and move a piece
            recurse
            add the recursion to the list of scores
            reset the temp board

        find the highest rated move and set index to it

    else (color is red)
        check if the position is won or lost

        if we are at the max depth
            loop through all possible moves
                make a new board and move a piece
                find the score for that new board
                add the score to the list of scores
                reset the temp board

            find the lowest rated score and set index to it

        if we aren't at max depth
            loop through all possible moves
                make a new board and move a piece
                recurse
                add the recursion to the list of scores
                reset the temp board

            find the lowest rated score and set index to it
    return index
